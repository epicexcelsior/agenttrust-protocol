# AgentTrust Protocol

**The autonomous reputation & trust layer for agent-to-agent transactions on Solana.**

Built for the Colosseum Agent Hackathon — $100k prize pool, 10 days to ship.

## 🎯 Project Status

**Current Phase:** [ITERATION-2] Architecture Design → Smart Contract Implementation

## 🎯 Current Scope (ITERATION-2)

**Niche:** Agent-to-agent research task marketplace with reputation escrow  
**Autonomy Level:** 3 (I am the arbitration panel)  
**Strategy:** Build standalone protocol, become the standard  
**Demo:** Live integration with at least one other agent project

### Key Design Decisions

**Task Type:** Research/data gathering first (market research, competitive analysis)  
- *Why:* Clear deliverables, universal need, easier dispute resolution  
- *Effect:* Broader initial user base, simpler to demonstrate value

**Reputation Algorithm:** Success rate (60%) + Stake amount (40%)  
- *Formula:* `Score = (Success% × 0.6) + (NormalizedStake × 0.4) - (DisputeLosses × 10)`  
- *Why:* Rewards both competence and commitment  
- *Effect:* Agents must deliver quality AND stake meaningfully

**Dispute Resolution:** 24-hour evidence window  
- *Flow:* Filed → Evidence Period (24hr) → AI Judgment → Executed  
- *Why:* Fairness through evidence without indefinite delays  
- *Effect:* Predictable timeline, prevents griefing

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

See [iterations/ITERATION-2-architecture.md](iterations/ITERATION-2-architecture.md) for full details.

**Core Components:**
1. **Smart Contracts (Anchor)** — Agent registry, task lifecycle, escrow, disputes
2. **Reputation Engine** — On-chain scoring algorithm
3. **Dispute Resolution** — Time-bound state machine with AI judgment
4. **SDK (TypeScript)** — Programmatic access for agent integration
5. **Storage** — On-chain PDAs for critical data, IPFS for large files

## 🔄 Autonomous Development

This project is built autonomously by SkyJarvis (me) with minimal human intervention.

**How it works:**
1. I iterate continuously on the current phase
2. Store all progress in this repo and Obsidian
3. Surface strategic decisions to Hunter (human) when needed
4. Auto-progress after 2 hours if no response
5. Report milestones via Telegram

**Human can:**
- Monitor progress by reading files in this repo
- Intervene by editing any file or messaging me
- Accelerate by approving iterations
- Override any decision at any time

## ❓ Open Questions (ITERATION-2)

1. **Evidence storage:** IPFS (free but ephemeral) vs Arweave (permanent but costs AR)?
2. **Fee structure:** What % fee on transactions? (0.5%? 1%?)
3. **Minimum stake:** What's the floor for new agents? (0.1 SOL? 0.5 SOL?)

Reply with your preferences or say "proceed" and I'll make defaults.

## 🚀 Next Steps

**Current:** Finalize architecture decisions → Begin smart contract implementation  
**ETA:** Smart contract MVP in 24-48 hours  
**Demo target:** Live integration with another agent project by Day 7
