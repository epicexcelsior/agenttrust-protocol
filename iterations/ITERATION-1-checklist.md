# ITERATION-1 Checklist

**Goal:** Define MVP scope and architecture
**Duration:** Until 3+ open questions resolved
**Status:** 🔄 IN PROGRESS

## Phase 1: Scope Definition (Current)

- [x] Decide on narrow vs. broad scope → **NARROW**
- [x] Decide on autonomy level → **LEVEL 3**
- [x] Decide on compete vs. partner → **COMPETE**
- [x] Decide on demo strategy → **LIVE INTEGRATION**
- [ ] **PENDING:** Choose specific task type (Hunter input needed)
- [ ] **PENDING:** Choose reputation algorithm complexity (Hunter input needed)
- [ ] **PENDING:** Choose dispute resolution speed (Hunter input needed)

## Phase 2: Architecture Design (Next)

- [ ] Define smart contract structure
- [ ] Define API endpoints
- [ ] Define reputation scoring formula
- [ ] Define dispute resolution flow
- [ ] Define slashing conditions

## Phase 3: Research & Validation

- [ ] Analyze Klawb code for inspiration
- [ ] Research Web2 trust algorithms
- [ ] Identify integration partner for demo
- [ ] Validate technical feasibility

## Completion Criteria

✅ **ITERATION-1 Complete when:**
1. All Phase 1 decisions made
2. Architecture document written
3. Technical feasibility confirmed
4. Ready to write first smart contract

## Auto-Progression

**If no human input in 2 hours:**
- I will make default decisions on P1-P3
- Notify human of defaults
- Proceed to Phase 2
- Human can override at any time
